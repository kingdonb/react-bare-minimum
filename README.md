# React Bare Minimum

A bare minimum setup to work with react. Compiling and bundling, nothing else.

* It compiles ES6 code containing JSX syntax
* It bundles your code to a single JavaScript file
* That's it all folks

*I'm sick of copy-pasting files and configuring when writing blog posts related to React. I just wanted something small which I download and start using.*
